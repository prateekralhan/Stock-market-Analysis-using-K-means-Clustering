# Stock-market-Analysis-using-K-means-Clustering

In this project, I used Stock Market data from yahoo finance and then use K-means Clustering Algorithm to detect similar 
companies based on their movements in the stock market.
It mainly deals with developing a pipeline that normalises the data and then run the algorithm to produce the lables that assign the companies to different clusters, like Mcdonalds, Mastercard, Symnatec, Apple, American Express, Sony etc.

The python code was implemented using Python 2 and was made in Jupyter Notebook using mainly numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
